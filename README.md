# TheWitnessTrainer
#### This repository makes use of the LWM-Trainer (https://github.com/survivalizeed/LWM-Trainer)
Please don't use this program to fake speedruns or such things.  
I originally created this trainer to be able to unlock everything until I reach my lost savegame but it  
turned out to be a nice side project to refresh my reversing, hacking and C++ skills :)
#### Tools used: Cheat Engine, x64dbg, IDApro, Visual Studio 2022 C++ and Defuse.ca x86 disassembler 
#### If you have any questions join my discord https://discord.gg/2B35mEXax8  
  
### Features:

- GameChanger
  - Fly (speed customizable) | You can fly through walls but it is still not a no clip hack, which means that you will probably glitch through the world 
  - FasterSprint (speed customizable) | Lets you customize your sprint speed
  - AllSolutionsWork | No matter how you draw the laser through the puzzle it will always be correct 
  - LeaveSolve | Pretty much the same as AllSolutionsWork but you don't have to drag it to the end. It will solve the puzzle as soon as you leave the puzzle. This is useful for partially locked puzzles
